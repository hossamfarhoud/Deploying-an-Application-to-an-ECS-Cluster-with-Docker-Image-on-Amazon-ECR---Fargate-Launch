*Title: Deploying an App to ECS Cluster with Docker on ECR & Fargate*

ðŸš€ *Project Overview*:
This project demonstrates how to deploy an application to an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster using a Docker image stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with the Fargate launch type. 

ðŸ”§ *What You'll Learn*:
- Setting up the ECS cluster and configuring the necessary services.
- Creating and pushing a Docker image to Amazon ECR.
- Configuring Fargate tasks and services for seamless deployment.
- Step-by-step instructions to ensure your environment is correctly set up.

ðŸ“– *Step-by-Step Guide*:
1. *Set Up Your Environment*:
   - Create an ECS cluster using the AWS Management Console.
   - Define task definitions and specify the Fargate launch type.

2. *Build and Push Docker Image*:
   - Build your applicationâ€™s Docker image locally.
   - Push the Docker image to your Amazon ECR repository.

3. *Create and Configure Fargate Services*:
   - Define the task and service configurations.
   - Set up networking, load balancers, and security groups.

4. *Deploy Your Application*:
   - Launch the ECS service with the configured Fargate tasks.
   - Monitor the deployment and troubleshoot any issues.

5. *Maintain and Scale*:
   - Use CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
   - Scale your services based on demand with automated settings.

ðŸ”— *Why Use ECS with Fargate?*:
- *Serverless Compute*: Fargate allows you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- *Scalability*: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
- *Security*: Enhanced security with AWS IAM roles and policies.

- Amazon ECS
- Amazon ECR
- Docker
- AWS Fargate
- AWS CloudWatch
